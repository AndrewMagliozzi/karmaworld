Storing Secrets
===============

Secrets are things that we have to specify to our app,
but do not want to check into source control.
These are stored as files in `karmaworld/karmaworld/secrets`


client_secrets.json
-------------------

`client_secrets.json` is the api drive authentication with google api services for authenticating the server-side of `gdrive.py` requests. It is generated by google and used in `gdrive.py`.


db_settings.py
--------------

`db_settings.py` stores data about the production database.

+ PROD_DB_NAME = "" # is the database name in postgres
+ PROD_DB_USERNAME = "" # is the postgres login username
+ PROD_DB_PASSWORD = "" # is the postgres login user password
